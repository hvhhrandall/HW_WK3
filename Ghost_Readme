"""I have attempted to make a turn based survival game called Ghostly Grove. This game is designed to prompt the player for a difficulty
rating between 1 and 10, the rating then acts as a multiplier to the number of turns that the player has to survive to win the game.
Each player turn is simply a prompt for a cardinal direction of travel. After the player chooses a direction, the player is notionaly 
advanced through the forest and one of several consequence options is implemented via a random int generator. One consequence involves a 5 
point deduction of health from the players original 100 point health bar. The only way to lose the game is to lose all health before 
completing all of the turns remaining. The player also has a chance to find gold, a chance for nothing to happen, and a chance for a 10 
second time penalty. While there is no actual map or structure to the forest, it does recognize the most immediate previous direction, and 
if the player repeats the last direction they took, their chance for a negative consequence is raised to 50% for that turn."""
